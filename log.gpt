ajax ver 4.6 (optimized for Band-4 FRB detection)
FILTERING ONLY MODE

INLINE MODE for FRB pipeline - read from and write to a shared memory
Mode of operation: PA
Input data is sampled as 1 byte integers

Lowest frequency :300 MHz
Bandwidth: 200 MHz
Sideband flag: 1. Frequency of first channel is 300 MHz
Number of channels: 4096
Sampling interval :1.31072 ms

Display window size has been adjusted to accomodate integer multiples of shared memory buffer
Display window size :5 sec

Number of channels excluded at start: 50
Number of channels excluded at end: 50

Number of bad subbands to exclude: -195085888

Channel flagging turned on. Details of procedure: 
	Bandhshape will be smoothened and then normalized.
	Normalized bandshape will be used to detect RFI.
	20 channels will be used as window length for smoothing
	CutOff to RMS ratio: 2.5

Time flagging turned on. Details of procedure: 
	2-D time-frequency data will be normalized using smoothened bandshape before filtering
	20 channels will be used as window length for smoothing
	Histogram based algorithm selected.
	CutOff to RMS ratio: 3

Filtered data will have a rescaled mean of 8192

Flagged samples will be ignored
